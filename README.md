# ProjectV2 - AI-Driven Incident Intrusion Detection Platform

## Overview

**ProjectV2** is an AI-driven web application aimed at network management with real-time threat detection, security orchestration, and automation. The platform is built using modern technologies including React for the frontend, and Flask for the backend, and leverages machine learning models for threat detection and recommendations.

**Please note:** This is a **prototype** version of the project and not fully developed. Some features may not be fully functional or integrated, and additional work is needed to refine the system.

## Features

- **Real-time Threat Detection**: Powered by machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies in network traffic. **Please note** that the threat detection is simulated in a controlled environment.
- **Security Orchestration**: Automated responses to detected threats.
- **Dashboard**: Provides insights and historical data related to detected threats and security status.
- **User Authentication**: Includes login and signup functionality (JWT-based authentication).

## Current Status

- The project is still in the prototype stage. 
- The frontend and backend are connected, and the basic structure of the application is in place.
- Some features, such as full threat detection, are yet to be implemented.
- **Threat detection is simulated in a controlled environment** and is not based on real-time data.

## Access the Project

You can access the project at the following link:

## How to Use

1. Visit the link above to access the app hosted on GitHub Pages.
2. You can log in or sign up to explore the application.
3. The dashboard will show a placeholder for now, as threat detection is still being developed.

## Future Plans

- **Complete the threat detection and response logic.**
- **Integrate more security features, including notifications and advanced security analysis.**
- **Enhance the user interface and experience.**
- **Test and deploy machine learning models for live threat detection.**

## Development

This project uses the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Flask
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
